# apitest
This is a tiny Python flask API to develop tests against.

It has 1 endpoint (/v1/identities/<user id>/events) and static data for 1 user ID (12), but any integer user ID should be valid.  It requires basic auth, for user "admin" and password "password"
  
Write whatever tests you think would be sufficient to test this.
